This project was created for NASA's Space Apps 2024 challenge.

The website is called Policy Path, and it is the first of its kind to bring together climate data and policies.

Using NASA's ODIAC climate change database, this website allows you to click anywhere in the world (or enter longitude and latitude) and see climate and policy data, including:
1. How carbon emission levels have changed over the years
2. Which climate change policies have been passed over the years
3. How each policy imapcted carbon emission levels

This website finally allows the population to see firsthand the effects of climate change policy. This allows everyone to understand which policies are effective and which arent, 
creating for the people a "policy path"-- an idea of which policies need to passed/continued to help bring an end to excessive carbon emissions!
